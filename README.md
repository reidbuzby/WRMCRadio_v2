# WRMC Radio

This is a mobile Radio Streaming application for the radio station WRMC 91.1 FM Middlebury College Radio. 

The application was developed with React Native for Android and iOS. The ios and android directories contain versions of the project that can be opened with Xcode and Android Studio. 

The key interpretable files are the JavaScript files found in the 'screens' directory. These are the main files used for each screen of our application, shared by both iOS and Android deployments. Another directory of interest is the 'assets' directory both in the root folder, and the android/ios folders that contain some imported assets. 

# To run locally in iOS:

After this is done, you should be able to build and run the project from Xcode.
